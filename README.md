# Bootsraps

VeChain [thor](https://github.com/vechain/thor) contains hard-coded bootstrap node list. Updating the list requires a software update. Hosting the list on Github Pages makes it convient and elegant 😏. The full list is in the file [nodes.list](./node.list), it can be accessed via HTTP request to https://vechain.github.io/bootstraps/nodes.list .
